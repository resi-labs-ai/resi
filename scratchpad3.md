Goals for Friday
- run miner for testnet on seperate machine (EC2)
- run validator locally
- see how validator scores the miner
- write up how validators can start on production in PM2

(Future - are miners just getting 41 listings from each zipcode - how do I incentivise them to get more?)
(Future - should move to digitial ocean for the vercel like experience for backend apis (fucked up trying to do something new on new software stack))
