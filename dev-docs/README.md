# Dev Documentation Directory

This directory contains development documentation, guides, and reference materials created during the development and enhancement of the Resi Labs Data Universe project.

## Naming Convention

All documentation files in this directory follow a sequential numbering system to maintain chronological order and easy reference:

```
NNNN-descriptive-name.md
```

Where:
- `NNNN` is a 4-digit zero-padded sequential number (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
- `descriptive-name` is a kebab-case description of the document's purpose
- `.md` extension for Markdown format

### Examples:
- `0001-miner-storage-validation.md` - First document about miner storage validation
- `0002-s3-upload-optimization.md` - Second document about S3 upload improvements
- `0003-testnet-configuration.md` - Third document about testnet setup

## Document Types

This directory may contain:
- **Validation Guides** - Instructions for testing and validating functionality
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical details about specific implementations
- **Configuration Guides** - Setup and configuration instructions
- **Troubleshooting Guides** - Common issues and solutions
- **API Documentation** - Endpoint and service documentation
- **Development Notes** - Notes from development sessions and decisions

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Always use sequential numbering** - Check the highest existing number and increment by 1
2. **Use descriptive names** - Make it clear what the document covers
3. **Include creation date** - Add a header with the creation date in each document
4. **Reference related files** - Link to related code files, tests, or other documentation
5. **Keep it organized** - Use consistent formatting and structure
