# API Rate Limiting & Deep Zipcode Scraping Requirements

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE: API Cost Explosion**

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Before Upgrade (Property Extended Search Only)**:
- 1 API call per zipcode ‚Üí gets ~41 properties
- 7,500 zipcodes √ó 1 call = 7,500 API calls/day
- Cost: Manageable within basic API limits

**After Upgrade (Two-Phase Individual Property API)**:
- 1 search call + 41 individual property calls per zipcode
- 7,500 zipcodes √ó 42 calls = **315,000 API calls/day**
- Cost: **42x increase** - exceeds even premium API limits!

### API Plan Comparison
| Plan | Monthly Limit | Daily Limit | Current Usage | New Usage | Overage |
|------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Basic | 13,000 | 433 | ‚úÖ 250 | ‚ùå 10,500 | 24x over |
| Premium | 198,000 | 6,600 | ‚úÖ 250 | ‚ùå 10,500 | 1.6x over |
| Enterprise | 1,000,000+ | 33,000+ | ‚úÖ 250 | ‚úÖ 10,500 | Within limits |

## üìã **REQUIREMENTS**

### 1. **Dynamic API Budget Management System**

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Monthly API budget configuration
ZILLOW_MONTHLY_API_CALLS=13000          # Default: Basic plan
ZILLOW_DAILY_BUFFER_PERCENT=10          # Keep 10% buffer
ZILLOW_API_PLAN_TYPE=basic              # basic|premium|enterprise

# Advanced rate limiting
ZILLOW_MAX_PROPERTIES_PER_ZIPCODE=41    # Configurable property limit
ZILLOW_ENABLE_DEEP_SCRAPING=false       # Enable multi-page zipcode scraping
ZILLOW_DEEP_SCRAPING_PAGES=3            # Max pages to scrape per zipcode

# Smart batching configuration
ZILLOW_SMART_BATCHING_PERCENT=60        # Only scrape top 60% of properties
ZILLOW_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD=500000        # Only full scrape properties > $500K
```

#### Dynamic Rate Calculation
```python
# Calculate safe daily API usage
monthly_calls = int(os.getenv("ZILLOW_MONTHLY_API_CALLS", "13000"))
buffer_percent = int(os.getenv("ZILLOW_DAILY_BUFFER_PERCENT", "10"))
days_in_month = 30

safe_daily_calls = (monthly_calls * (100 - buffer_percent) / 100) / days_in_month
properties_per_zipcode = int(os.getenv("ZILLOW_MAX_PROPERTIES_PER_ZIPCODE", "41"))
calls_per_zipcode = 1 + properties_per_zipcode  # 1 search + N individual

max_zipcodes_per_day = safe_daily_calls // calls_per_zipcode
zipcode_scrape_interval = (24 * 60 * 60) / max_zipcodes_per_day  # seconds between zipcodes
```

### 2. **Tiered Scraping Strategy**

#### Tier 1: Basic Properties (Property Extended Search Only)
- Properties < $500K or low-priority zipcodes
- 1 API call per zipcode (current method)
- ~22 fields per property

#### Tier 2: Premium Properties (Full Individual Property API)
- Properties > $500K or high-priority zipcodes
- 1 + N API calls per zipcode (new method)
- ~100+ fields per property

#### Tier 3: Deep Zipcode Scraping
- Multi-page scraping for high-value zipcodes
- Track property changes over time (delta tracking)
- Pagination through all available properties

### 3. **Deep Zipcode Scraping System**

#### Multi-Page Property Discovery
```python
async def deep_scrape_zipcode(zipcode: str, max_pages: int = 3):
    """
    Scrape all pages for a zipcode to get complete property inventory
    
    Phase 1: Discovery - Get all ZPIDs across multiple pages
    Phase 2: Selection - Apply smart batching and priority scoring  
    Phase 3: Collection - Fetch individual property details
    Phase 4: Delta Tracking - Compare with previous scrapes
    """
    all_zpids = []
    
    # Phase 1: Multi-page discovery
    for page in range(1, max_pages + 1):
        search_results = await fetch_property_search(zipcode, page)
        page_zpids = extract_zpids(search_results)
        all_zpids.extend(page_zpids)
        
        if len(page_zpids) < 41:  # Last page
            break
    
    # Phase 2: Smart selection based on budget
    selected_zpids = apply_smart_selection(all_zpids, api_budget_remaining)
    
    # Phase 3: Individual property collection
    properties = await fetch_individual_properties(selected_zpids)
    
    # Phase 4: Delta tracking
    deltas = calculate_property_deltas(zipcode, properties)
    
    return properties, deltas
```

#### Delta Tracking System
```python
class PropertyDeltaTracker:
    """Track property changes over time for efficient re-scraping"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_scrape_cache = {}  # zpid -> last_scraped_data
        self.change_frequency = {}   # zpid -> change_frequency_score
    
    def calculate_deltas(self, zipcode: str, current_properties: List[Property]):
        """
        Compare current scrape with previous scrape to identify:
        - New properties (not seen before)
        - Changed properties (price, status, details changed)
        - Removed properties (no longer available)
        """
        
    def get_priority_properties(self, zipcode: str) -> List[str]:
        """
        Return ZPIDs that should be prioritized for full scraping:
        - High-change frequency properties
        - Recently changed properties
        - High-value properties
        """
```
