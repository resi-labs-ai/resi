## Attribution & Technical Foundation

**Subnet 46 (RESI) is built upon the proven architecture of [Subnet 13: Data Universe](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/data-universe) by Macrocosmos.com.**

We extend our sincere gratitude to the ResiLabs team, particularly [Arrmlet](https://github.com/Arrmlet) and [ewekazoo](https://github.com/ewekazoo), for creating the robust, scalable data collection and validation framework that serves as our foundation. Their pioneering work on decentralized data collection, consensus mechanisms, and anti-gaming protections has enabled us to focus on real estate specialization rather than rebuilding core infrastructure.

**Key adaptations for real estate:**
- Specialized data sources (Zillow, county assessors, MLS feeds, public records)
- Property-specific validation mechanisms
- Real estate market-focused incentive structures

## The Problem: Price Barriers, Data Fragmentation, and Restrictive Terms Lock Out Innovation

Real estate data is the lifeblood of a $45 trillion industry, yet it's trapped behind three critical barriers:

**1. Prohibitive Pricing**: Base-level access to comprehensive real estate databases come with unjustifiable costs to the tune of $250K+ per year per customer.

**2. Data Fragmentation**: Critical property information is scattered across thousands of county assessors, MLS systems, and tens of proprietary databases, requiring separate expensive contracts for each source.

**3. Restrictive Terms**: Data providers use licensing terms that prevent AI companies like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok from training on this data, protecting monopolistic moats while stifling innovation.

The result? Small businesses, researchers, and developers are completely priced out, while even well-funded AI companies can't access the data needed to build transformative real estate intelligence applications.

## Our Solution: Open Source, Real-Time, Decentralized Intelligence

**RESI creates the first open, real-time, national real estate database powered by decentralized intelligence.**

*The Thesis: By creating an ecosystem that continuously learns from miner scraping, user data inputs, and behavior, products on RESI will ultimately build collective real estate super intelligence that drastically outperforms all closed systems.*

We're opening Pandora's box on real estate data by enabling miners to collect from any accessible source - Zillow, county assessors, thousands of public records, and even consumer behavior - then making it accessible through modern APIs with field-level confidence tracking and temporal decay algorithms.

This creates a **real-time national database** that serves as the foundational infrastructure for highly profitable and scalable real estate solutions across all sectors. Unlike corporate data silos that price out innovation, our decentralized approach enables AI applications impossible for any single company to build.

**The Vision**: Start with 150M+ properties in the USA, then scale globally to create the world's most comprehensive open real estate intelligence network that powers the next generation of PropTech innovation.

# Introduction

Subnet 46, Resi Labs, is a data-scraping and sentiment analysis subnet owned by ResiLabs.ai. It collects and stores large amounts of data from across a wide-range of sources for use by other Subnets and businesses. Resi Labs scrapes real-time data initially from the Zillow Rapid API.

Resi Labs aims to be the world's largest open-source real estate dataset, highlighting its efficiency and business use cases. Its datasets are easy to access, so businesses and other subnets can use them quickly and with low-friction.

Resi Labs was built on top of Data Universe's foundation which was built ground-up with a focus on decentralization and scalability. There is no centralized entity that controls the data; the data is stored across all Miners on the network, and is queryable via the Validators. At launch, Resi Labs will be able to support 150 Million USA based real estate listings across 200 miners, while only requiring ~10GB of storage on the Validator.

# Product Roadmap

ResiLabs will launch its own products built with subnet 46:

## Platform Applications To Be Built on RESI Data

### Seller Intent Prediction

# Overview

The Resi Labs documentation assumes you are familiar with basic Bittensor concepts: Miners, Validators, and incentives. If you need a primer, please check out https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

In the Resi Labs, Miners scrape data from a defined set of sources, called DataSources. Each piece of data (e.g. a webpage, BTC prices), called a DataEntity, is stored in the miner's database. Each DataEntity belongs to exactly one DataEntityBucket, which is uniquely identified by its DataEntityBucketId, a tuple of: where the data came from (DataSource), when it was created (TimeBucket), and a classification of the data (DataLabel, e.g. a stock ticker symbol). The full set of DataEntityBuckets on a Miner is referred to as its MinerIndex.

Validators periodically query each Miner to fetch their latest MinerIndexes and store them in a local database. This gives the Validator a complete understanding of all data that's stored on the network, as well as which Miners to query for specific types of data. Validators also periodically verify the correctness of the data stored on Miners and reward Miners based on the amount of [valuable data](#data-value) the Miner has. Validators log to [wandb](https://wandb.ai/ResiLabs/Resi Labs-validators) anonymously by default.

Miners upload their local stores to S3-compatible storage for public dataset access. This data is anonymized for privacy purposes to comply with the Terms of Service per each data source.

- For S3 storage setup, see the [S3 Storage documentation](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/Resi Labs-api).

The S3 storage option provides improved scalability, security, and performance, especially for large datasets. It uses a folder-based structure with blockchain authentication to ensure miners can only access their own data while validators can efficiently access all miners' data.

See the [Miner](docs/miner.md) and [Validator](docs/validator.md) docs for more information about how they work, as well as setup instructions.

# Incentive Mechanism

As described above, each Miner reports its MinerIndex to the Validator. The MinerIndex details how much and what type of data the Miner has. The Miner is then scored based on 2 dimensions:
1. How much data the Miner has and how valuable that data is.
1. How credible the Miner is.

## Data Value

Not all data is equally valuable! There are several factors used to determine data value:

### 1) Data Freshness

Fresh data is more valuable than old data, and data older than a certain threshold is not scored.

As of Dec 11th, 2023 data older than 30 days is not scored. This may increase in future.

### 2) Data Desirability

Resi Labs will maintain a [Dynamic Desirability List](docs/dynamic_desirability.md) that defines which types of data are desirable according to user requests from our future product that will allow for user requests. Data deemed desirable is scored more highly. Unspecified labels get the default_scale_factor of 0.3, meaning they score less than half value in comparison.

The DataDesirabilityLookup will evolve over time, but each change will be announced ahead of time to give Miners adequate time to prepare for the update.

### 3) Duplication Factor

Data that's stored by many Miners is less valuable than data stored by only a few. The value of a piece of data is decreases proportional to the number of Miners storing it.

## Miner Credibility

Validators remain suspicious of Miners and so they periodically check a sample of data from each Miner's MinerIndex, to verify the data correctness. The Validator uses these checks to track a Miner's credibility, which it then uses to scale a Miner's score. The scaling is done in such a way that it is **always** worse for a Miner to misrepresent what types and how much data it has.

# Resi Labs Dashboard

As you can see from the above, Resi Labs rewards diversity of data (storing 200 copies of the same data isn't exactly beneficial!)

To help understand the current data on the Subnet, the Resi Labs team hosts a dashboard (https://sn13-dashboard.api.ResiLabs.ai/), showing the amount of each type of data (by DataEntityBucketId) on the Subnet. Miners are strongly encouraged to use this dashboard to customize their [Miner Configuration](./docs/miner.md#configuring-the-miner), to maximize their rewards.

# Use Cases

subnet 46, Resi Labs, has a range of use-cases:

- Low-cost data-scraping that undercuts centralized and decentralized alternatives.
- Aid in market research in any industry by collecting social media results on pressing topics.
- Help boost the accuracy of predictive tools by injecting them with freshly scraped social media data.
- Understand global online sentiment on any topic, to help inform businesses on their goals.
- Track sports analytics on social media (used by Subnet 44, Score).
- Forecast performance of assets (used by Subnet 64, Chutes, via Squad.ai).

Resi Labs's potential is extensive, as anybody can use it to build datasets on whatever topics are meaningful to them. By tapping into Bittensor's miner and validator communities, people can access data scraping and analysis at a fast and affordable rate.

# Terminology

**DataEntity:** A single "item" of data collected by a Miner. Each DataEntity has a URI, that the Validators can use to retrieve the item from its DataSource.

**DataEntityBucket:** A logical grouping of DataEntities, based on its DataEntityBucketId.

**DataEntityBucketId:** The unique identifier for a DataEntityBucket. It contains the TimeBucket, DataSource, and DataLabel.

**DataLabel:** A label associated with a DataEntity. Precisely what the label represents is unique to the DataSource. For example, for a Yahoo finance DataSource, the label is the stock ticker of the finance data.

**DataSource:** A source from which Miners scrape data.

**Miner Credibility**: A per-miner rating, based on how often they pass data validation checks. Used to heavily penalize Miner's who misrepresent their MinerIndex.

**Miner Index**: A summary of how much and what types of data a Miner has. Specifically, it's a list of DataEntityBuckets.
