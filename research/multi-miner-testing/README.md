# Multi-Miner Testing Research Archive

## 📋 **Research Summary**

This folder contains all files, scripts, and documentation from the multi-miner network evaluation experiment conducted on September 10-11, 2025.

## 🎯 **Experiment Objectives**

**Primary Goal**: Scale from single miner-validator to multiple miners for full network simulation
**Key Focus**: Organic strategy development and S3 upload functionality

## ✅ **What Was Accomplished**

### 1. **Multi-Miner Network Setup**
- ✅ Created 3 additional miners (UIDs 7, 8, 9) on testnet 428
- ✅ Configured separate databases and S3 state files for isolation
- ✅ Implemented accelerated 5-minute evaluation cycles (vs 60 minutes)
- ✅ Enabled organic strategy development (no pre-assigned territories)

### 2. **S3 Upload Issue Resolution**
- ❌ **Problem**: S3 uploads failing due to platform mapping mismatch
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Dynamic desirability used `"rapid_zillow"`, S3 uploader only recognized `"zillow"`
- ✅ **Fix**: Updated `upload_utils/s3_uploader.py` to support both platform names
- ✅ **Additional Fix**: Created comprehensive zipcode configuration (182 zipcodes)

### 3. **Configuration Management**
- ✅ Database isolation per miner
- ✅ Separate S3 state files
- ✅ Environment variable support for testnet acceleration
- ✅ Proper hotkey-based S3 partitioning

## ❌ **Issues Encountered**

### 1. **Process Management Problems**
- Multiple duplicate processes causing resource conflicts
- Screen session management complexity
- Miners 3 and 4 intermittent failures

### 2. **S3 Upload Challenges**
- Platform mapping mismatches
- Label mismatches between dynamic desirability and actual data
- Only Miner 2 consistently uploading to S3

### 3. **Configuration Complexity**
- Too many moving parts (screen sessions, state files, databases)
- Difficult to troubleshoot multiple concurrent processes
- Need for simpler terminal-based monitoring

## 📁 **File Inventory**

### **Scripts & Tools**
- `check_s3_upload_progress.py` - S3 upload monitoring tool
- `organic_analysis.py` - Strategy development analysis
- `verify_experiment_health.py` - Overall health monitoring
- `restart_organic_experiment.sh` - Automated restart script
- `monitor_organic_strategies.sh` - Strategy monitoring

### **Documentation**
- `S3_UPLOAD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete S3 troubleshooting guide
- `ORGANIC_STRATEGY_EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full experiment documentation

### **Configuration Files**
- `.env_miner_*` - Environment configurations per miner
- `total_*.json` - Dynamic desirability configurations (various versions)
- `state_file_miner*_s3_partitioned.json` - S3 upload state tracking

### **Data & Logs**
- `SqliteMinerStorage_miner*.sqlite*` - Miner databases and WAL files
- `miner_startup.log` / `miner_restart.log` - Process logs

## 🎓 **Key Learnings**

### **What Worked Well**
1. **Database Isolation**: Separate SQLite files prevented conflicts
2. **Accelerated Testing**: 5-minute cycles enabled rapid iteration
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic debugging identified exact issues
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for future reference

### **What Needs Improvement**
1. **Process Management**: Simpler terminal-based approach preferred
2. **Configuration Complexity**: Too many interdependent files
3. **Error Handling**: Better error reporting and recovery mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time status visibility needed

## 🚀 **Recommendations for Future Testing**

### **Simplified Approach**
1. **Use separate terminal windows** instead of screen sessions
2. **Start with single miner** validation before scaling
3. **Test S3 uploads independently** before full network testing
4. **Create single configuration file** per miner

### **Process Improvements**
1. **Automated health checks** with clear pass/fail indicators
2. **Real-time dashboard** for multi-miner status
3. **Graceful error recovery** mechanisms
4. **Simplified cleanup procedures**

### **Technical Improvements**
1. **Better platform mapping** handling in S3 uploader
2. **Dynamic configuration validation** before startup
3. **Resource usage monitoring** during multi-miner operation
4. **Automatic duplicate process detection**

## 📊 **Final Status**

**Experiment Status**: Partially Successful
- ✅ Multi-miner network architecture validated
- ✅ S3 upload issues identified and resolved
- ✅ Organic strategy development framework established
- ❌ Consistent multi-miner operation not achieved
- ❌ Complex process management caused reliability issues

**Next Steps**: Implement simplified terminal-based approach with lessons learned from this research.
